# Law firm site
This is the first of many projects by **The Breaking Benjamins** ("TBB") -- a group of legendary coders from all around 'Merica.

The final deliverable can be found [here.](https://jnolan97.github.io/LawFirmSite/)

You may find the original requirenments [here.](https://classroom.google.com/c/OTQ5OTQ1MDk1MDNa/a/MTAwMTAxODgxMjQ1/details)

In summary, TBB was tasked with:
* Replicating a website for a law firm
* Working remotely using GitHub

## Common site elements
**Logo(s)/Header**
The "logo" in this site is actually a combination of an art icon and the firm's name. Technically, it's two logos in one. No functionality to them.

**Nav bar**
Nav bar contains links to more information about the company. "WHO WE ARE" and "WHAT WE DO" tabs link to other pages within the website.

**Footer**
Styled a footer with links resembling that of the mockup page. The links take you from page to page.

## Main page
The main page shows users:
* a nav bar with all sections of the site, 
* a main photo, 
* a welcome message, 
* a scroll-enabled news feed, and, 
* an address section with contact info.

## What We Do
The What We Do pag displays:
* images with borders,
* a list to the side of the page,
* navbar and,
* a footer linking to other pages on the site.

## Who We Are
The Who We Are page displays 
* a column with text and an image. 
* It also shows a text area on the right followed by five placeholder images with borders. 
* The nav bar and footer allow the user to navigate to other pages within the site.
